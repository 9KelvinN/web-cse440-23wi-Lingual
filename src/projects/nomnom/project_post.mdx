## Problem and Design Overview
<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageRestaurantInfoMrWest,
    }}
    caption={
        "NomNom shows you user-contributed data, but it also has features that make sure your own experiences count."
    }
    width={6}

NomNom is an app that helps you find restaurants for yourself or a group, while
taking into account your dietary restrictions and preferences. 

Dietary restrictions are common in the United States.
More than half of Americans report some form of dietary restrictions, whether due to
allergies, religious or cultural practices, or personal preference.
But people can hesitate to ask for accommodations or assert their food
preferences, because they are embarrassed that _their_ specific dietary
restrictions may not be important or prevalent enough.
We don't want people to feel like their needs have to either be deadly or optional.

NomNom's design attempts to simplify the process of documenting dietary restrictions,
while facilitating the discovery of new restaurants that meet these requirements.
In a group setting, we also want to make it easy for your group to find food that
meets everybody's needs. Either way, your own voice and experiences should always
be valued and respected.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

People with different dietary restrictions can have different relationships with food.
Depending on how well they are accommodated, they might also navigate the 
restaurant selection process differently.
Because there are so many kinds of dietary restrictions, our design research
needs to account for this diversity.
By learning about our participants' most pressing needs, we can determine what priorities require our attention.

We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with four participants 
to understand how they select restaurants, how they navigate group dining if they have
dietary restrictions, and how they accommodate other people with these restrictions.
The semi-structured format allowed our participants to tell us what they feel is notable and
allowed us to follow-up with questions about their decision-making process.

Our participants vary in stages of life and restaurant dining frequencies.
They also all have different kinds of dietary restrictions—diagnosed allergies, religious
practices, adopted diets, and no dietary restrictions at all—and
we intentionally made sure our participant pool is diverse in this respect.

### Eating with a group is the most pressing, unresolved problem

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageFoodPartyVotingButtons,
            caption: "In our digital prototype, the Food Party feature was designed in response to our participants'" +
                " frustrations in group settings.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>
Our research found that dining with a group is often the most challenging and unresolved
issue for our participants. 
This is a complex process—there are the logistics in data sharing, but it is also a process that 
requires emotional safety.
And sometimes, people suffer from indecision and just hate to be the person to decide for a group.

As the number of group members increases, this frustration also grows exponentially.

### Restaurant discovery should be a first-class task
We found that people are in fact eager to explore and share new restaurants, 
even if they do not consistently have the opportunity to do so.

Our participants shared that they all maintain a list of “safe restaurants” that
they frequently revisit if they do not know where to eat.
However, they also all expressed a desire to try new places, as long as that process
feels safe and not exhausting.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### The ability to self-track-and-report matters, because third-party data alone can not be trusted

From our participants' responses, we inferred that being able to self-track
and report dietary restrictions and restaurant experiences is an important need.
Relying solely on business-provided diet data alone, as modern map apps typically do, 
is not enough to keep people safe.
Even if a restaurant claims to be accommodating to a specific dietary restriction, there may
still be cross-contamination issues in the kitchen. And many issues such as poor service
or bad communication cannot be predicted by third-party data sources and require “actual suffering”.

Our product must allow users to track their own experiences in some way. Even at the prototype stage,
it is just inconceivable that there is a perfect external data source that we can rely on.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

After creating tasks based on our design research and finalizing the mobile app format
to design for, we narrowed the tasks down to two main ones:

- Find a restaurant for everyone when you dine with a group for the first time.
- “Red-flagging” a restaurant after having a disappointing experience.

Our design process began with creating an initial paper prototype. For that, we included the necessary
features for our tasks; however, we did not focus on usability at this stage.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePrototypeAll,
            caption: "Our initial paper prototype.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>

We then conducted
heuristic evaluation and usability testing. First, we invited other groups in CSE 440 to give us
feedback on the design based on Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics. Then, we invited four additional
participants who are not in this class to participate in a usability study.

Based on each round
of feedback, we made revisions to improve the design. Here are some of the lessons we 
learned along the way.

### Designing against the abusive ex-partner

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageLeaveButtonsMarked,
    }}
    caption={
        "We retroactively added features to kick out a member and to leave a group in a Food Party."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Designing for
vulnerable populations should not be an afterthought, but when creating our initial prototype,
we did not account for potential issues related to online safety.
In our usability testing, some participants tried to look for escape hatches but could not find them.

For example, in our group Food Party feature, once a user gets invited by somebody, they would be forced to
finish the entire restaurant selection workflow—which requires everybody else's consensus—and had no
easy way to leave the process early.
For one participant, the _lack_ of an escape feature was noticeable and almost seemed confusing. In 
this particular case, we added a way to leave a group, among other similar features
(such as being able to remove someone from a group).

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Internal state changes are not obvious to everyone

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageAddedHistoryText,
    }}
    caption={
        "Messages like this one explicitly describe changes in internal state."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

During our design process, we made an unintentional assumption that all users
would be familiar with the concept of our "History" tab, and that they would understand
how a restaurant might end up there. This tab displays both red flagged and visited restaurants,
including restaurants selected from the group Food Party feature.

During usability testing, however, it became apparent people can have different degrees of understanding
depending on their prior background with technology.
To partially address this issue, we began adding help text that describes changes in internal state
(e.g., “we also added this restaurant to your history!”). 

</ProjectImageBlock>

### When we invent word usages, we have to define them

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageVotingExplainer,
    }}
    caption={
        "We added explicit explanations for our terms, especially if a feature is used for the first time."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

We received a lot of positive feedback about the voting process designed for
the group Food Party feature.
However, some participants did not find the option names (“Yes!”, “Meh”, and “Veto”) to be immediately
intuitive. We soon realized that their understanding of the features depended on the order with
which we prescribed our tasks in usability testing.

We cannot expect that our users would use our app in some specific order, so it is our job to make
sure our design allows anyone to understand our app, no matter their background.
We created an overall onboarding page that explains the features of the app before the sign-in screen.
If it is the first time that someone votes, we will also explicitly
explain how the restaurants were selected for this process and what their voting options would do. 

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Resulting Design

Finally, we created our digital prototype using Figma. 

### Onboarding

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageDigitalOnboard,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "The onboarding screen is displayed before the user enters their credentials or creates an account."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}>

    You will see an onboarding screen the first time that use this app. 
    Instead of our default landing page, you will also be directed to Profile tab to 
    set your dietary restrictions.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageDigitalProfile,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "After creating your account, you will also be asked to select your initial dietary restrictions. You can always come back and edit this."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>


</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Restaurant information and red flagging
<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageDigitalFlag}
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "On a restaurant's information page, you can find menu items that work for you. You can also record a bad experience with that restaurant by “red flagging” it."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}>

    Our default landing page is a listing of the restaurants that meet your dietary 
    restrictions. You can click on an entry to find out more about their menu.
    
    On the
    restaurant's own information page, you can also record other structured information,
    such as tags for yourself or to “red flag” the business—one of our major tasks.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Food Party

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageDigitalParty1,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "To begin, you would create a new group and start a food party with them."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}
>

One of our main tasks involves eating out with a group and making sure that 
the restaurant selected would work for everybody. The Food Party is 
a major feature in our app that is designed for that task.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageDigitalParty2,
        },
        {
            src: imageDigitalParty3,
        },
        {
            src: imageDigitalParty4,
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "In this case, your might have voted 'Yes' or 'Meh'. Your group finished voting with only one round."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}>
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageDigitalParty5}
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "But a few rounds of voting may be needed to complete the restaurant selection. The app lets you know if that needs to happen."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}>
