## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *   - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *     Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

Roughly only 20% of Americans know more than one language. One of the reasons this 
number is so low is because learning a new language is often repetitive, tedious,
and boring. How do we solve this issue? Shockingly, the average American watches 
roughly three hours of television a day, so what if they spent part of this time 
learning a new langauge by watching something in the foreign language?

This is what Lingual aims to do: help users learn a new language through watching
TV shows, movies, or reading books. With the Lingual app, a user can select the 
desired language to be learned and get curated recommendations based on their 
proficiency levels. They are also able to connect and converse with other users
who are learning the same language and watching the same content, allowing the
users to improve their conversational fluency as well. 

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

To address our problem, we decided to gage any shortcomings in current language 
learning methods (such as the classroom and current language learning applications)
and evaluate interest in engaging supplements like entertainment. We then chose to
conduct three semi-structured interviews to gather these insights because interviews
provided direct audience interaction allowing us to pry into particular shortcomings
and any supplement preferences. We wanted available interview participants with current
or previous language experience so interviewed two current University of Washington
language students and a user of Duolingo.

Our interview questions started out with broad questions about their language background.
From there we asked the following questions involving their classroom experience/platform.
- How they felt about certain aspects of their current language learning system
- How they engaged in the non-primary language outside of a classroom environment, if at all
- How proficient they were in different aspects of the language (writing, speaking, reading, etc.)

### 3 Key Insights
#### Existing Language Learning Structures focus on grammar and vocabulary more than speaking and listening
Classrooms have occasional speaking and listening exercises, but the grammar and vocabulary is often
the focus and the bulk of coursework. Duolingo has a similar pattern as the majority of the exercises
are reading/matching and users may even skip speaking/listening exercises. This tends to present a steep
learning curve for new learners with regards to becoming conversationally fluent.

#### Existing Language Learning Structures occasionally feel like a chore and ineffective 
TOWRITE
While a user may practice everyday, they may not learn much because they only spend 5-10 minutes each day.
Many apps have some sort of reward system or “tokens” that gamify language learning. To some extent this shifts the focus of the app to collect these rewards rather than learning the language.

#### There is wide interest in engaging with foreign media
barrier is understanding the content

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights
### Reaching a Paper Prototype

We began by making many prospective design sketches and storyboards before we narrowed to making a
mobile application focusing on two tasks: Finding media content at the appropriate difficulty level
and finding a community/conversational partner. We then made a paper prototype for the mobile 
application that we took into testing iterations.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Testing Process
We iterated on our prototype through two heuristic evaluations based on Nielson’s 10 Usability
Heuristics and three usability tests. Our heuristic evaluations were done during CSE440 lecture and
allowed for numerous text and button fixes. For our usability tests, our first participant was a
Duolingo user and took place in their apartment. We chose this person and environment because
they're a part of our target audience and the environment emulates where they'd typically be using
the Lingual app. After conducting this test, we refined our background introduction and tasks to
become much clearer.

Our second participant was a student and took place in Mary Gates Hall. We selected this individual
because they were in our quiz section and they had interest in learning a language. Their advice
provided many specific visual improvements.

Our last participant was a previous language student and took place in CSE2. We chose this person
because they had expressed interest in more entertaining language supplements. They helped to clarify
that the design was clear but also pointed out issues with our placement test process.

Our resulting design supports two main tasks: Allowing users to discover media content in a foreign 
language that fits their language comprehension ability, and helping users find a community/a conversational partner for the language being learned.
</ProjectImageBlock>

### Task 1: Discover media content in a foreign language that fits one's language comprehension ability

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Task11,
            caption: "Figure 1.",
        },
        {
            src: Task12,
            caption: "Figure 2.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
>
Once the user creates an account, they are prompted to select which languages they would 
like to learn (Figure 1) and which genres of media they enjoy consuming (Figure 2). 
For this example, the user chooses Spanish and that they enjoy comedy.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Task13,
            caption: "Figure 3.",
        },
        {
            src: Task14,
            caption: "Figure 4.",

        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
>
The user then proceeds to take a placement quiz for the languages the selected (Figure 3). 
This quiz is meant to measure their baseline proficiency and is used to generate inital media recommentations. 
They recieve a Lingual Score that represents their relative proficiency in that language (Figure 4). 
The user can increase their Lingual Score by completing check-in quizzes about a show or movie they are watching.   
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Task15,
            caption: "Figure 5.",

        },
        {
            src: Task16,
            caption: "Figure 6.",

        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
>
After completing the baseline proficiency quiz and recieving their Lingual Score, they are brought to the Discover page, 
where they can browse curated shows, movies, and books are recommended to them (Figure 5). 
These recommendations are based off of their input favored genres and their current proficiency. 
They can engage with the media by clicking on each thumbnail (Figure 6).

</ProjectImagesBlock>



### Task 2: Find a community/a conversational partner for a language being learned


<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Task21,
            caption: "Figure 7.",
        },
        {
            src: Task22,
            caption: "Figure 8.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
>
On the Conversations page in the app, the user can toggle between their individual chats or their group chats (Figure 7). 
The user can also search for specific individuals or groups they are in. 
To join a new group or start chatting with a new individual, the user presses the plus button on the top right of the screen.
They are then presented with the option to join a group or converse with an individual.
</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: Task23,
            caption: "Figure 9.",
        },
        {
            src: Task24,
            caption: "Figure 10.",
        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
>
For this example, the user wants to join a new group to discuss the current show they are watching.
Based on the show or novel that the user is currently watching, the app will recommend groups that are in
roughly the same spot as the user (Figure 9). The user is then able to join the group to practice
their conversational skills and discuss the content of the show or novel (Figure 10).
