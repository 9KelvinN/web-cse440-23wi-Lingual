## Problem and Design Overview

Problem and design overview text here.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

You might want to use headings, sub-headings, and sub-sub-headings for organization. For example:

### Process

A nice section for you to write about your process.

### Key Insights

You can use even smaller headings here!

#### Descriptive Title

Super helpful insight here.

#### Another Descriptive Title

Another super helpful insight here.

#### One Final Descriptive Title

One final super helpful insight.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{src: winstonRaincoat}}
    caption="Winston wearing a raincoat."
    width={8}
>
After a single paragraph describing your design process, you'll probably want to include an overview image of your paper prototype. I don't have a paper prototype, I just have a really cute dog.
</ProjectImageBlock>

Make sure to **include key insights** here too. It's in **bold**, so no excuses!

## Resulting Design

Your incredible final design!

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {src: winstonTheo},
        {src: winstonPlane},
    ]}
    caption="Winston and Theo taking a nap (left); Winston flying in style (right)."
    direction="row"
    width={8}
>
This section will have a lot of images. You can use the *ProjectImagesBlock* component to display several images together.
</ProjectImagesBlock>
