## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *   - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *     Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

The evergrowing clothes industry has detrimental effects on our planet both in 
creating clothing and disposing unworn items. It has more greenhouse gas emissions 
than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. Additionally, every year, 
the average American throws away 81.5 lbs of clothes. Globally, 92 million tonnes
of clothing waste end up in landfills per year. It takes a toll on the environment
to favor the acquistion of new items while neglecting what we already own.

That's where Green Closet comes in. Green Closet allows participants to keep track of
what they are wearing and how often they are wearing it. In turn, participants
can identfy their most and least used items in their closet and either change
their outfits or give away what they no longer need. In doing so, Green Closet
helps people to ensure they do not own or acquire clothes they won't wear and 
encourage recyling and thrifting over buying new items.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

People have different reasons and motivations behind their actions and that includes those
pertaining to their closet. For example, a shirt may be unworn because it's forgotten or because
it's hard to outfit plan around. Similarly, how we then attempt to solve the issue needs to
match the motivation of our targeted user group (fashion, environment, money, etc.) or else 
we risk creating a solution nobody wants.

For our design research, we chose to do a survey followed by interviews because the survey 
allowed us to poll a large number of people with minimal effort and narrow down our problem 
space. From there, we were able to decide what questions and areas to explore more during our 
interviews rather than exploring ideas on the fly or based on assumptions. We chose to focus on 
UW students since they are easily accessible. Additionally, young adults are more likely to 
engage in fast fashion, thrifting, and exchanging clothes via an app so they would be able 
to take advantage of or be in need of our app's services.

### Most people do not use their entire closets, with a general high estimate of about 70% of clothes used regularly.

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: researchClosetUsed,
    }}
    caption={
        "How much of their closet do people report wearing?"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

From our survey, 87.5% of participants estimated that they use 80% or less of their closet 
on a daily basis. In our interviews, all participants estimated at or below 70% use, with only 3 
participants saying they used over 70% of their closets, so people do not utilize all of their 
clothes.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

We focused our design on two tasks: optimizing how a participant utilizes their
 closet and facilitating the exchange of secondhand clothes. Our iterative
  design process began by creating an initial paper prototype of our application.
   Then we ran two heuristic evaluations on it, identifying and resolving
    violations. Next, we conducted three usability tests. Our participants
     were college students with varying degrees of familiarity with self-tracking
      applications. Two of our participants had experience thrifting and valued
       sustainability in fashion. We began each test by giving a summary of our
        project and our design and explaining our two tasks. Then we had users
         attempt to complete both tasks with the prototype. We improved our design
          based on feedback from the participants. Finally, we created a digital
           mockup of our application.


### Added Workflow to Exchange a Specific Piece of Clothing

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
    }}
    caption={
        "This is a caption."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

This insight emerged during our first usability test when the participant clicked
 the “exchange” button on a specific item and we had no screen to show other than
  the “give” view of the exchange page. To address this, we added a “pre-post”
   window where the participant can add additional information about an item before
    posting it on the app, such as a title, description, price, tags, and images.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Further Integrated User Statistics

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
    }}
    caption={
        "This is a caption."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

This insight also emerged during our first usability test after the participant
 had completed both design tasks. They had previous experience with self-tracking
  apps and wished that statistics related to themselves and their closet use
   were easier to locate. To address this, we integrated user statistics more
    throughout the application. On the profile page we added a graph that displays
     the user’s closest usage over time in addition to a button that navigates
      to the “stats” view of the closet page. When a user selects an item in their
       closet, there is now a button on that page that takes them to a detailed
        view of that item’s statistics. There is also a button that navigates to
         an item’s statistics when the user selects a piece on the home page.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Modified Button Descriptions to Add Clarity

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imagePlaceholder1200x800,
    }}
    caption={
        "This is a caption."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

This insight emerged during our third usability test when the participant was
 unclear on how to confirm the wear of an outfit for the day. They thought that,
  by adding a piece of clothing to the daily outfit, they were confirming the
   wear of that piece. To address this we changed the description of the check
    mark under a specific item of clothing to “Add to outfit” instead of “Wear it!”,
     and the description of the check mark on the home page to “Wear it!”.
      That way, it’s clear that the check mark buttons do different things.
