## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *   - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *     Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

It's late at night. After a long solo walk from campus, you are finally getting 
home from your group meeting. Approaching your apartment, you realize your 
neighbor is also getting back from studying and is unlocking the main
door just ahead of you. As you walk up the stairs together, you find out that 
they were in the same building working two floors down from your favorite study spot.

This situation has happened to most of us in one form or another. Both students 
and safety professionals have noted that travelling in groups is far preferred 
over commuting alone. Living in the city, students are put at risk every time a 
class or project meeting gets out late and no one else from the group is headed 
in the same direction. What if we extended that circle?  We realized that, as 
students, there is almost always someone we know nearby. However, it is difficult 
to connect when even a 30 second difference in departure time can destroy the
possibility of overlapping paths.

To solve this problem, Huddle connects people who already know each other before 
leaving for their destination. By collecting data about people's commutes, 
we can broadcast the data to other people they already trust, thus
maximizing the opportunity to have a partner for even part of a commute.

Safety goes beyond companionship, however. We realized that we can't change 
the relative safety of an area, but we are able to alter how students react to it. 
This is where the second component of our design comes in. Whether walking
alone or in a huddle, app users also have access to our Safer Route mapping. 
This feature combines real-time safety updates with general safety trends as 
reported by other users. It provides an extra level of awareness for anyone 
trying to get around campus, independent of others' availability.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

For our design research process, we wanted to find UW students who were living on 
or around the U District area to see if they happened to experience any instances 
whilst commuting in which they felt unsafe. We chose to conduct semi-structured 
interviews because we had specific questions we wanted to ask, but wanted to have 
flexibility in the conversation based on the students' responses. We interviewed 
3 computer science students: a sophomore who takes the lightrail, a junior who 
usually walks home, and sophomore who busses. We selected these students because 
they had been commuting around Seattle for at least a year and would be our 
target audience for improving their commuting experience.

### Seeing the Same People on the Way Home But Not Approaching Them

When asked if they saw familiar faces in their daily commutes, our participants 
explained that they would see the same people on the bus or while walking from 
home to class everyday, but were timid or uncomfortable with the idea of just 
walking up and approaching them. One participant said that he wished there was 
a way for him to talk to those people. Another participant mentioned the 
recognition of those familiar faces being friends of their friends who they 
knew lived in the same place as them.

### Want to Stay Connected to Others, But Need to Be Aware of Surroundings

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: friendsImage,
            caption: "At night, when someone doesn't want to walk home alone, they can go on their phone to find a friend.",
        },
        {
            src: busImage,
            caption: "We wanted to make bussing less intimidating with live alerts and suggested things to do inbetween waiting.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our participants stated that they wanted to keep talking with their friends  
while they were commuting, but found it difficult because they also had to 
be extra aware of what was going on around them. One participant said that 
she commonly uses FaceTime to call her friends on her commute, while 
another says that she doesn't because "when my phone is on speaker, I don’t 
like people hearing my conversations and I don’t want to put earbuds in 
cause I want to be aware of my surroundings.” Our last participant said, "I 
usually double check to make sure no one’s following me and stuff,” 
gesturing that he looks over his shoulder frequently. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Waiting For the Bus Can Be Scary, Unreliable, and Time-Consuming

All of our participants mentioned that they had used the bus before to commute 
to a destination. One of our participants says that “Waiting at the bus stop 
by myself can be scary.” Another says that while bussing may be safer, she 
often opts to walk because of how unreliable the buses can be.
As a result of these findings, we wanted to add a feature to our design that 
allowed for timely alerts of any events that would affect someone's route and, 
as a result, update the route to reflect any changes from the alerts.

## Resulting Design

### Startup Sequence

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/home.png",
        },
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/sign-up.png",
        },
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/login.png",
        },
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/tutorial.png",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

To get started, students can create an account and use UW single sign-on to verify 
that they are a UW student. There is also an option to toggle accessible routing 
if a user needs it. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/tutorial-sequence.png",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Tutorial sequence"
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Once signed up, the app executes a tutorial of the home screen. The home (huddle) 
screen displays where the user can input their next commute, a section showing the 
current huddle, any huddle requests they have received, and a section for messages.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Adding Friends

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/profile.png",
        },
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/friends.png",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    caption={
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

In the profile screen, a user can change their settings such as who they allow 
friend requests from. "Contacts only" allows people that are already in the 
user's saved phone contacts to be added as friends on the app, while "contacts 
and friends of existing friends" allows a user to also add people their friends 
have in their friends list. Consequently, in the Friends screen, the user can 
view their friends, people they can add from their contacts (and people their 
friends have added if they chose this setting), and any incoming friend requests. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Build a Huddle to Commute With Friends

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/huddle.png",
        },
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/update-status.png",
        },
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/updated-status.png",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

A user can input their commute status, which will allow their status to be seen 
by friends. Commute status includes where they're starting their route, where 
they're headed, and around what time they'd like to make the commute.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/send-request.png",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

A request for a huddle can be sent through "Find a Huddle". A user can select 
a friend they'd like to commute with and send them a request based on time and 
location to meet up. 

</ProjectImagesBlock>

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/receive-request.png",
        },
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/accepted-request.png",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    caption={
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

After a request is sent, the friend will get a notification that will appear 
in the huddle requests section. Once accepted, the huddle will show up in the 
"active huddles" section for both parties. Messages will also display further 
communication leaving it open for any changes.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

#### Finding a Safe Route

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: "/assets/posts/route.png",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

A user can start looking for a commute route after inputting their start and 
end locations. Our app will display route options and recommend a route based 
on safety from post-route safety data from users and route information. At the 
end of the commute, users can submit ratings for the route.

</ProjectImagesBlock>
